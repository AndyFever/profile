                          The Edge Software Consultancy is a supplier of knowledge-based solutions for managing intellectual property
                          to the Biopharmaceutical, Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industry.  My role was to introduce modern development
                          practices to start regularly delivering application software to customers and the sales team.
                          This target was achieved with iterations regularly delivery customer quality products.

                              Implementing technologies and techniques within the Development team to increase
                              the velocity of projects as well as increase quality. This included updating infrastructure the
                              team was using and the development and tests environments used by individuals.

                            <li>
                              Introduced <em>Business Driven Development</em> within the team to help the Product Owners define
                              high level requirements and the Testers and Developers implement them.  This allowed the
                              testers to use the requirements as part of their automation efforts by using
                              the <em>Cucumber framework</em>.

                            <li>
                              Regularly liaised with the Directors and Product Owners to setup and manage the product
                              backlogs. This included pruning an unprioritised backlog of 700+ historical tickets to a prioritised
                              list of less than 50 giving the Development team a more focused roadmap.

                            <li>
                              Worked with the Customer Support Team to improve the process of getting feedback fed into
                              the development stream. This meant ideas from customers that fitted in with the Roadmap
                              could be turned around in weeks rather than the previous year’s wait.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Improved the Continuous Integration process so that the time taken for the unit tests to run
                              was reduced by 45% and regular feedback was reviewed by the team.  This in conjunction with the BDD
                              tests meant we were continually reviewing and improving quality.

                          TES is a globally recognised brand that supports the largest network of teachers in the world. I joined to address problems identified
                          in the Test Team and Development Team. I identified a need for a change in methodology and Test Strategy. Soon the team changed to a
                          structured manual and automated test approach.
                          <ul>
                              <li>
                                Reviewing the purpose, quality and approach to the existing testing at TES. Successfully implemented
                                a testing regime that allowed the Testers to accumulate the skills needed to successfully move to the DevOps team.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Implementing the Test Strategy, we built a suite of the manual and automated test aimed at key business workflows. The
                                DevOps engineers adopted our approach and used the tests for all live releases.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Helping the team go from a Waterfall methodology to an Agile approach. Key to achieving this was gaining support from the
                                Project Managers, Developers and key business people.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Regular performance reviews with team members. This successfully identified where people’s skills were insufficient.
                                They received structured training so they could support the Test Strategy.
                              </li>

                              Developing new strategies for testing existing and new products in different ways, (e.g. Automation, Web Services and
                              Performance Testing) and communicating it to Senior Management

                              Cut down inefficient testing practices by forming product teams with specializations within their
                              functional area and recruiting highly qualified team members

                              Ensuring that the Testing Policy reflects modern testing/development practice and that it is consistently applied to projects.
                              This involved making sure those projects were compliant for both internal audits and customer audits

                            <li>
                              Improved efficiency of testing by over 20% on low risk projects and patches by introducing Risk Based Testing

                              Ensuring that the IT infrastructure of the team is of the required standard, i.e. adopting virtual server technology, upgrading from
                              TestDirector to Quality Center and reviewing customer technology strategies

                              This was especially important when it came too non-functional testing on projects where the right skills were not in the team

                              Andy is a dedicated Quality-focused professional who is able to effectively balance the competing resourcing requirements of multiple complex projects running in parallel. As a line manager he can nurture the individual without
