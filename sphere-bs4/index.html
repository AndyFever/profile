                          The Edge Software Consultancy Ltd is a supplier of knowledge-based solutions for managing
                          intellectual property to the Biopharmaceutical, Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industry.
                          My role was to introduce modern development practices to start regularly delivering software to
                          customers and the sales team. We manged to successfully do this with three large projects
                          released in under a year whilst still maintaining customer support.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                              Implementing development technologies and techniques within the Development team to increase
                              the velocity of projects as well as increase quality. This included updating infrastructure the
                              team was using and the development and tests environments used by individuals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Built an automated test function within the test team from scratch. Developed the skills within
                              the team to support the framework whilst maintaining goals for improved quality at each step.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Introduced Business Driven Development within the team to help the Product Owners define
                              high level requirements and the Testers and Developers implement them.  This allowed the
                              testers to use the requirements as part of their automation efforts by using
                              the Cucumber framework
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Regularly liaised with the Directors and Product Owners to setup and manage the product
                              backlogs. This included pruning an unprioritised backlog of 700+ tickets to a prioritised
                              list of less than 50 giving the Development team a more focused roadmap.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Worked with the Customer Support Team to improve the process of getting feedback fed into
                              the development stream. This meant ideas from customers that fitted in with the Roadmap
                              could be turned around in weeks rather than the previous year’s wait.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Improved the Continuous Integration process so that the time taken for the unit tests to run
                              was reduced by 45% and regular feedback was reviewed by the team.

                          TES is a globally recognised brand that supports the biggest network of teachers in the world.
                          Before I joined it was recognised that the QA Team was no longer functioning correctly
                          within the team and it was my role to address it.  This role changed to Senior Software Engineer
                          in Nov 2014 as part of a move to Scrum
                          <ul>

                                Reviewing the purpose, quality and approach of the existing testing at TES. Successfully implemented
                                a testing regime that allowed the Testers to accumulate the skills needed to successfully move to the DevOps team
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Reviewing ongoing project portfolio and resourcing appropriately.
                                Even during the engineering restructure, the team managed to deliver high profile projects
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Working with manual testers, we built core automation skills within the team to automate key business workflows.
                                The toolset was successful and was adopted by the infrastructure team as part of their release process
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Helping the team go from a Waterfall methodology to an Agile approach. This involved getting the team set up to
                                support Continuous Delivery. This was a key part of my role as a Senior Software Engineer
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Regular performance reviews with team members. This successfully identified where people’s skills were
                                insufficient and helped them to get to where we needed them to be
                              </li>

                          AQA is the largest of the three main UK exam boards providing GCSEs and A-Levels.  AQA’s activities have a national prominence and
                          its commitment to quality meant the Systems QA Manager was a key role.  My team supported mission-critical applications that
                          directly affected the success of the company. The team supported web applications, finance systems including
